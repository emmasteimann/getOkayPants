Okay Pants Downloader
=========

Purpose....
-----------
I made my original comic downloader for Scary Go Round, but then I wondered if I could expand it to do my most favorite web comic of all time [Okay Pants](http://web.archive.org/web/20070620013447/http://www.okaypants.com/comic.php). Sure enough got it to work, web archive where it still lives sadly does 302 redirects for all internal links, HTTP Service Unavailable if pinged to often and dead pages and images, which required some not so great work arounds.

Each chapter loads into its own `.cbz` file. Which can be used with most comic readers. For Mac, see [Simple Comic](http://dancingtortoise.com/simplecomic/) or [Jomic](http://jomic.sourceforge.net/).

How to use...
-----------
A downloader tool for my favorite webcomic.

  - Run `bundle`
  - Run `bundle exec ruby getOkayPants.rb`
  - Enjoy all of Okay Pants!

What this does....
-----------

This downloads the entirety of Okay Pants from 2003-2007, when Julie Keene, sadly, disappeared off the face of the planet.
